# AWS Cost Report

This tool will collect and create Daily & Monthly AWS cost reports and put them into [Slack](https://slack.com/)

The format should be like this

```

<date> - Amazon Simple Storage Service: $<value>
<date> - AWS Key Management Service: $<value>
<date> - AWS Data Pipeline: $<value>
```
Total Spent: `<value>`

## Before Start

This tool uses a specific file that is generated by AWS. To activate the generation, you should activate the [Detailed billing report with resources and tags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-reports.html#other-reports)

## Recomendations

In order to fully take advantage of the potential, you should Tag your resources accordingly, otherwise you will see a lot of this

```
<date> - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (): $<value>
```
